# Project Title:
### Prediction of hotel industry with the help of seaborn graphics library.

# Tools and Technology:
### 1. Jupyter Notebook.
### 2. Python Programing Language.
### 3. Numpy (Python Libery_)
### 4. Seaborn(Python Libery_)
### 5. Pandas(Python Libery_)
### 6. Matplot(Python Libery_)
### 7. Google Colab.

# Problem Statement:
### The organization has been provided “tips.csv” dataset including various columns such as total bills,tip amount,gender ,person per bill and days of the week.As a data science engineer my task is predict and analyse dataset using Seaborn visualization library and generate insights and explore the relationship between different columns according to the needs.
### Task-1:Plot the trends between columns total_bill across tip
### Task-2:Find out which day has a maximum or minimum,along with that number of customers.
### Task-3:Predict which day number of customers rate should be high.
### Task-4:Plot all the columns in single graph
### Task-5:Find out relation between different different columns
### Task-6:Find out cumulative frequency on the basis of future on the total amount
### Task-7:Find out how many customers has give high number of rupees on particular day
### Task-8:Use the statistics and find out which column contains maximum outliers(errors)
### Task-9:Visualize tip across total bill in such a way outliers and range show in asingle plot
### Task-10:Visualize total bills separately for each particular day

# Project Approach:
### 1.Data Pre-Processing
### 2. Scatter Plot
### 3. Custmize Plot in Seaborn
### 4.Barplot & Count Plot
### 5.Histogram
### 6.Pair Plot
### 7.Corelational Maxtix / Heatmap
### 8.Violin Plot
### 9. Kernal Density Estimate Plot
### 10.Joint Plot
### 11.Rug Plot
### 12.Strip Plot
### 13. Box Plot
### 14. Boxen Plot
### 15.Regression Plot
